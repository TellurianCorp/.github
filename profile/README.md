# Tellurian Corp

Helping teams modernize their finance and infrastructure operations with practical, secure software.

## What We Build

| Project | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| **TellurianBI** | Go-based control plane that handles routing, authentication, admin tooling, and observability for every Tellurian service. |
| **Tellurian Web Admin** | React/TypeScript front-end that gives operators an intuitive way to manage clients, DNS zones, finance data, and more through TellurianBI. |
| **Automation Tooling** | CLIs and scripts for provisioning credentials, configuring environments, and running diagnostics so engineers can focus on shipping features. |
